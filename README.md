# Slatify

There are many notification and communication systems. You can choose any of them. I chose [Slack][2] for communication, then I integrated notifications.

This repository is dedicated to sending messages to [Slack][2].

Here you find simple and useful solutions for sending messages to [Slack][2] automatically. Same functionality are (will be) realised with all methods.

If something is missing, [mail me][1], I'll do my best to compensate it. And new solutions are comming.
